                    My name is Richard Vargas. I am an easy-going person. My hobbies include listening to music, watching movies, and playing video games. My musical taste varies from moment to moment really. I'll find myself listening to hip-hop when I want to turn up, some film scores to help me focus, and rock to help destress. I love wacthing mostly super hero movies, but I will tune into the occasional sci-fi and thriller type films. The type of games I play are almost all single player/story driven games. I am a college graduated. I received a BA in Communication Studies from the University of Texas ar Arlington. Throughout the regular weekdays in Houston you can find me working at the Marathon Oil Corporation. I am a mail room clerk, handling and assisting in package delivery. Anytime outside of that I spend doing my hobbies, with my family and now, learning to code with the UT Houston Bootcamp system.</p>
